## Details

Gadgets4You is a UK-based E-Commerce store operating mainly in Europe that sells all kinds of items from lunch boxes to party supplies to decorations.

They are approaching your agency with a csv file of raw data from their shop software, saying they don’t have any other way to answer some important business questions about the status quo than to get external help from you, as their shop software provider doesn’t offer any kind of dashboard and nobody at Gadgets4You is capable of understanding the huge amount of transaction data.

You and your team are happily accepting the job to query the transaction data provided.

## Deliverable

In this project prepare a presentation for the company’s CMO, using your findings from the data provided in the CVS file and the answers to the questions shared by Gadgets4You.
