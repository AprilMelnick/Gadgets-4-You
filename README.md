## Project Details

Gadgets4You is a UK-based E-Commerce store operating mainly in Europe that sells all kinds of items from lunch boxes to party supplies to decorations.

They are approaching your agency with a csv file of raw data from their shop software, saying they don’t have any other way to answer some important business questions about the status quo than to get external help from you, as their shop software provider doesn’t offer any kind of dashboard and nobody at Gadgets4You is capable of understanding the huge amount of transaction data.

You and your team are happily accepting the job to query the transaction data provided.

-  What is the name and number of the bestselling product and how many times has it been sold?
-  Which products have been sold only once within the time range and have ‘Blue’ in their name?
